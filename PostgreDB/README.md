## üîó Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships

- category_label_mappings ‚Üí labels (A mapping can be used by multiple labels)

## üîç Indexes

The following indexes are implemented for query optimization:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_account ON transactions(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_label ON transactions(label_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_date ON transactions(transaction_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_recurring_label ON recurring_transactions(label_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_recurring_next ON recurring_transactions(next_occurrence);
CREATE INDEX idx_labels_category ON labels(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_account_recurring ON account_recurring_transactions(recurring_id);
```

## Key Differences from Original Schema

1. Unified transactions table instead of separate Expenses and Incomes
2. Introduction of category_label_mappings for validation
3. Simplified label structure with ENUM types
4. Removed redundant timestamp fields
5. More structured approach to categories and labels
6. Improved transaction naming and description fields

## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database
2. Execute schema.sql to create the database structure
3. Execute data.sql to populate with sample data
4. Configure application connection settings
